## Part Four: Objectivity, Objectivity, Objectivity!

The key to successful investing is to be completely objective - about yourself,the world, and every aspect of everything. Any time we are no sufficiently objective, our gamma goes up.

### 4.1 We Are Extremely  Unreliable

​	It's easy to despair when looking at research done by psychologists around the world over the years. They have repeatedly shown us one result: humans are completely unreliable, and we make absolutely terrible decisions.

​	Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002, and his research partner, Amos Tversky, discovered many years ago that people have and extreme aversion to loss. We've already mentioned several times that the pain of losing a dollar greatly exceeds the pleasure of gaining a dollar. Actually, even the way that we describe something can lead to different choices.

​	For instance, a paper by Benedetoo De Martino and his collaborators describes an experiment in which participants were told that they had received  an amount  of money, such as fifty British pounds. They were told that they would not necessarily be able to keep all of the money, but would instead have to choose between a "sure" option, in which they would keep a portion of the money,  and a "gamble" option, in which they would either keep all of the money of lose all of the money. The expected outcomes of both options were the same, meaning that the average results of the "gamble", if repeated over time, would be the same as the "sure" option. For each round of the experiment, subjects were split into two groups, with the only difference being that the "sure" option was framed in different ways:

> - Gain frame: you can keep 20 out of the 50 pounds.
> - Loss frame: you will loss 30 out of the 50 pounds.

​	Obviously, the results of these two frames are the same, because the subject ends up with 20 pounds no matter what. But since the second frame described a loss, the tests subjects' loss aversion was activated. The key is what happened next: the activation of their loss aversion influenced their subsequent decisions.

​	While only 42.9% of the subjects who had been presented with the Gain frame chose to gamble, 61.6% f the subjects who had been presented with the Loss frame decided to gamble. Remember, the amount that participants would keep with the "sure" was the same for both frames - the only difference was the way the option was described. Furthermore, this effect was present in all of the test subjects, albeit  to various degrees.

​	It turns out that people take many risks because they are afraid! Or, to put it another way, it turns out that the reason many people take risks is not that they are brave! And furthermore, the thing that they are afraid of doesn't exist...

​	But we're not done yet...

​	The most interesting part of the experiment was perhaps the post-experiment interview. Most of the subjects, when directly asked, were unware of any bias, but 20% of them were aware of the framing effect, and they couldn't really understand why they had made the choices that they did. Their feelings can be described like this:

> I knew what was happening, but I couldn't control myself...

​	This is really scary. Even when we know what is going on, we still can't control ourselves.

​	The results of this experiment should leave serious investors like us speechless and terrified. Why? Because we are investing with our own money, not just twenty British pounds. And we're not just investing with the money that we have today, but also with our future money and time. We have our money, our time, and what we believe to be a correct goal, but now we see somethings we may be unable to stop ourselves from making a wrong or even catostrophic decision, even when we know exactly what is happening! Could anything be more terrifying than this? It's like a ghost story or horror movie! Ghost stories are all the same, from east to west, from past to present, and you can sum them up in one sentence: for some reason, the main character sees themself moving toward destruction, but there is nothing they can do, even though they can see it happening, because they can't control themself...

​	This experiment still wasn't over, though. As the subjects made their choices, the researchers monitored their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology(fMRi), and they observed an incredible phenomenon.

​	This image basically reveals why we can't control ourselves.

​	The results the experiment showed that when the subjects were unable to control their loss aversion their amygdalae were extremely active. What are the amygdalae? They are two almond-shaped clusters of neurons in the brain that play an important role in our decision-making, memory, and emotions or moods. They can trigger emergency responses such as the fight or flight reflex when we are faced with danger. The amygdalae are small , but they are extremely important in processing emotions, particularly fear.

​	if you look back on times when you have felt extremely fearful, you will remember that your fear wasn't just an emotional state, but also a physical one. Your heart rate increased, our stomach felt empty, you felt uncomfortable, and you began to sweat. You felt like your brain empty, because your brain lacked blood and oxygen. This emergency response of the amygdalae was what doomed the subjects; it was what caused the subject to feel, "I knew what was happening but I couldn't control myself".

​	Even more disappointing is that we are unwilling to change. When our mistakes are pointed out to us, we become even more stubborn in our mistaken choices. At this point, you're probably thinking,"But I'm not like this , am I?" Allow  me to answer to you : you are like this, because we are all like this to some extent. 

​	Francis Bacon made the following observation:

> Once a human intellect has adopted an opinion(either as something it likes or as something generally accepted), it draws everything else in to  confirm and support it.

​	What about when that opinion is proven wrong? Nassim Taleb observed the following:

> "My characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn't introspect, doesn't exploit, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on."

​	In The Behavioral Investor, Daniel Crosby used the debates over plastic bags and gun control as examples:

> - Making a paper bag takes three times as much water as making a plastic bag; only 24% of people reuse paper bags versus 67% reuse of plastic bags; paper production creates 70% more air pollution than plastic production; it takes 91% more energy to recycle a pound of paper than a pound of plastic
> - 98% of guns used in the commission of a crime are stolen; over 100000 people successfully defend themselves with a gun each year; 9 times out of 10 gun owners defend themselves without firing a shot; more people drown each year than have been accidentally shot since 1980; kitchen knives kill ten times as many people each year as assault weapons.

​	It doesn't matter which side you belong to, the important thing is that we can see how strongly people hold their opinions and, if we observe carefully, we will be surprised to see how the fierceness of the debate has nothing to do with the facts. It's as if people don't care about the facts- all they care about is whether they win or loss. Facts and figures can't change people's opinion. if you win, you keep fighting; if you lose, you keep fighting. And if you happen to notice the facts, will they defeat you? No , you'll keep on looking for facts that support your opinion.

​	This phenomenon of an opinion growing stronger in the face of evidence that proves it wrong is called" the backfire effect"  in psychology. Researchers have discovered that the backfire effect becomes even stronger when the evidence that contradicts the opinion is slightly ambiguous. For instance, after a relatively uneventful  New Year's Day in the year 2000, those who thought that Armageddon was coming at the turn of the millennium didn't think, "Oh, it turned out I was wrong, maybe Armageddon isn't coming" Instead, they thought, "Maybe it's not coming right at the year 2000", or "Maybe it has been delayed because we weren't pious enough".

​	The backfire effect, and its tendency to be even stronger when there is not 100% clarity, is even more obvious in investing, The clearest example is the prognosticator who constantly gives inaccurate predictions. They may have been proven wrong many times, but because there is so much uncertainty in the investing world, they not only don't admit defeat, they double down,saying, "Just you wait!" I'll be proven right someday!

​	There are so many ways in which we are unreliable. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky started exploring behavioral economics around 1972. We now also have behavioral psychology and behavioral finance. More than 130 common cognitive biases have been identified(most of them are listed on this Wikipedia page), and I'm sure many more will be discovered.

​	Overconfidence leads to mistakes, protecting our self-image leads to mistakes, the way we talk about things leads to mistakes, our moods lead to mistakes, a lack of rest leads to mistakes, changes in blood sugar levels lead to mistakes, and even sunlight can make us more likely to make mistakes. Furthermore, our perception of risk is always incorrect, our perception of gains and losses is twisted, a lack of information can cause mistakes, and too much information can cause mistakes. The list goes on and on. Even worse, even when we are aware of our biases we still can't  control ourselves, and when we've clearly been proven wrong we double down on our beliefs.

​	Can you see how unreliable we are?
